The workflow of the my simulation study is as follows:
- All the main simulation code is in ```simulations/run_sim.R```. Running that R script should generate all simulation data across all given parameter combinations and save intermediate results for the current parameter combination to a .RDA file in ```results/sim_[method]/scenario_[i].RDA``` . For example, the 10th parameter combination calculating bootstrap t confidence intervals would be in ```results/sim_boot_t/scenario_10.RDA```.
- When you run ```run_sim.R``` it will call 5 other helper functions to actually generate data and extract estimates.
- Helper functions are stored in the ```source``` folder. There are 5 R scripts in there: ```gen_data.R``` generates data given an n, beta, and error distribution, ```fit_lm.R``` fits a linear regression model to a given dataset, ```run_bootstrap.R``` generates a specified number of bootstrap samples, and ```get_estimates.R``` extracts Wald/Bootstrap percentile/Bootstrap t estimates given a dataset.
- Tables and figures summarizing bias, coverage, and computation time from my simulation study can be found in ```analysis/HW1_simulations.pdf```. I have included both the knitted pdf and the RMD file in the ```analysis``` folder.
